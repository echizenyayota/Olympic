### A 0:02 - 0:12

I'm a left handed pitcher and I play both in the United States and Japan.

### B 0:22 - 0:32

Is that good?My name is Monica Abbott.I am 31 year old.I am from Salinas,California.

### C 0:57 - 1:10 

For it come back the excitement around the sports is incredible.Worldwide everyone that has watched play knows the softball is back in the sports of Olympics.

### D 1:54 - 2:05

I came over in Japan after the two thousand eight Olympic. My first year playing for Toyota was two thousand nine.And more than anything gave me the oppotunity to continue to play.

### E 2:10 - 2:20

We do have the league in the United States but the league in Japan is definitely strongest in the world.And gave me the chance to continue my career.

### G 3:28 - 4:09

And you know I was kind of like against it. At first then but finally I think kind of  tought about it and talk with my family and really my good friends,Natasha Watley came over and I decided you know I'm gonna come from for one year.

And I'm goona come for one year just try to learn from Japanese softball players, try to learn the culture, and things thar they do well in the softball so that maybe If I don’t like it, then I’m going to go home.But I liked that. So I’m staying here for nine years.

### H. 6:43 - 7:09

I have the dream to compete in Tokyo twenty twenty. And It we’ll be weird but it'll also be really fun to like to play on the Olympics stages against teammates or people that have watched you play in Japan softball league if you watch me play for Toyota for a while. And the come watch me play for team USA versus team Japan. They are my friends you know off the field, but on the field.got to get them.
